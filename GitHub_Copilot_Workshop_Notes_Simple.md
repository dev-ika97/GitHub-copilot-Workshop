# Knowledge Sharing: GitHub Copilot Workshop
**Date:** Thursday, 6 November 2025  
**Duration:** 4-hour hands-on lab  

---

## Lab 1 – Setup  
**Summary:**  
- Set up the development environment and logged into GitHub.  
- Created a new repository and configured Visual Studio Code with GitHub Copilot.  
**Goal achieved:** Environment ready for using GitHub Copilot.

---

## Lab 2 – Exploring the Codebase with GitHub Copilot  
**Objective:** Learn how to understand and explore unfamiliar codebases using Copilot Chat.  

**Key Learnings:**  
- Use Ask mode to query, understand, and navigate through code.  
- Identify project structure, dependencies, and build/test processes.  
- Different modes in Copilot Chat:  
  - Ask: Get explanations and clarifications.  
  - Edit: Modify and refactor code.  
  - Agent: Handle multi-file or complex tasks.  
- Try multiple AI models for better insights.  
**Tip:** Always verify AI-provided setup or build instructions manually.

---

## Lab 3 – Generating Unit Tests  
**Key Learnings:**  
- Use Edit mode to generate and refine unit tests.  
- Be specific in prompts for best results.  
- Always review AI-generated code for accuracy and quality.

---

## Lab 4 – Agent Mode Overview  
**What It Does:**  
Agent Mode can autonomously execute larger, goal-oriented tasks such as multi-file changes, refactoring, and documentation updates.  

**Highlights:**  
- Works toward specific objectives with minimal guidance.  
- Handles multiple files and tracks progress.  
- Ideal for large-scale refactors, feature implementation, or documentation generation.  
**Best Practice:** Set clear goals and always validate the Agent’s output.

---

## Lab 5 – Agentic Coding with GitHub Issues  
**Concept:** Treat Copilot as a team member.  
- Assign issues directly to @copilot.  
- Copilot works autonomously in a secure GitHub Actions environment.  
- You can assign tasks via GitHub Issues, Agent Panel, Visual Studio Code, or Command Line Interface.  
**Outcome:** Enables parallel development and improves productivity.

---

## Lab 6 – Using Model Context Protocols (MCP)  
**Purpose:** Integrate external services directly into your Integrated Development Environment (IDE).  

**Benefits:**  
- Access APIs, documentation, or project tools without switching windows.  
- MCP Registry allows one-click installation of connectors.  
- Supports both user and repository-level configuration.  
**Result:** A more connected, efficient, and streamlined development workflow.

---

## Final Takeaways  
- GitHub Copilot supports multiple modes (Ask, Edit, Agent) for different tasks.  
- Agent Mode allows for autonomous, multi-step coding tasks.  
- MCP integration brings external data and services directly into your workflow.  
- Custom instruction files can improve consistency and reduce prompt repetition.

**Overall Insight:**  
This workshop provided a solid hands-on understanding of GitHub Copilot’s advanced features — from exploring and editing code to autonomous task handling and external integration. It is a valuable productivity tool that can significantly speed up development and onboarding when used with proper review and validation.
