Assign Tasks to Copilot: You can assign tasks to Copilot just like you would to any team member, using GitHub Issues or other supported workflows.

Three AI Modes:
Ask: Get explanations or answers about existing code.
Edit: Modify or generate code with AI assistance.
Agent: Handle multi-file or complex tasks autonomously.

Model Context Protocol (MCP): Allows Copilot to connect with external services and tools directly from your IDE, reducing context switching and improving workflow efficiency.
Best Practice: Always review AI-generated code and instructions to ensure correctness.
